    a. 
  * _Objects_  
    a.
* __Other Contexts__
  * _Primitives_  
    a. 
  * _Objects_  
    a.
* __Behaviors:__
  * Things that happen but don't appear visually in "Frames" or "Objects"

__Actual Happenings:__
* __Global Context__
  * _Primitives_  
    a. 
  * _Objects_  
    a.
* __Other Contexts__
  * _Primitives_
